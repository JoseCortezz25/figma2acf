# Vite/React/Tailwind Figma Plugin Template

Everything you need to bootstrap a Figma plugin with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS.

## Features
- React, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn-ui for a modern, accessible, and responsive UI.
- Vite provides for a fast and effortless developer experience.
- All interprocess communication boilerplate is taken care of and handled with an easy to use messaging system.
- Just one simple command to build, run, and publish your plugin.
- Automatically bundles all your assets into one file for easy compatibility with Figma.
- Import SVGs as React components, URLs, or raw strings.
- Write styles with Sass/Scss/Less and modules.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. In Figma, create a new plugin by going to *Plugins â€º Development â€º New Pluginâ€¦* and in the windows that follow, choose "Figma" as the platform and either "Default" or "Run once" as a template (it doesn't matter so much which one you choose, because you will only need the manifest from the generated files), and finally click "Save as" to save it to a temporary directory on disk.
4. Locate the `manifest.json` file that was generated in the previous step and copy the `id` field from it.
4. Paste the `id` field into `figma.manifest.ts` in the root of your plugin (this project) and configure the manifest however you like. (See [Official Figma Plugin Manifest doc](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/)).
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server and create a `dist/` folder, which will include your plugin's `manifest.json`.
6. Load your plugin in Figma by going to  *Plugins â€º Development â€º Import plugin from manifestâ€¦* and selecting your plugin's `manifest.json` file.
7. (Optional) Turn on Figma's `Hot reload plugin` option to automatically reload your plugin when files in `dist/` changes.

## UI-only Development

To run your UI code in the browser, without Figma context or your plugin's back end logic, run:
```
npm run dev:ui-only
```

## Publishing Your Plugin

As with `npm run dev`, running `npm run build` will create a `dist/` folder, which will contain your plugin's `manifest.json` and all the assets necessary to load your plugin in Figma, as well as all of the files necessary to publish your plugin to the Figma Community.
